            <h2>Dropbox</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Link to Dropbox:</strong> lets you to link to or unlink from your Dropbox account.
                    You need to link to your Dropbox if you want to use Marvin’s quick Dropbox function.</li>
                <li><strong>Download search path:</strong> by default, Marvin will search
                    for books everywhere in your Dropbox. If you want to restrict Marvin to search in a 
                    sub-folder, you can specify it here.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recently opened list:</strong> determines how many books
                    to show when access your most recently opened books from the home screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Long list scrubber:</strong> shows a scrubbing bar at the bottom of most list screens when they are long.
                    This helps you scan for items quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Square covers:</strong> shows book covers as square images (as opposed to proportionally sized images) in
                        your library when you’re in regular, condensed, or large text list viewing modes.</li>
                <li><strong>List info line:</strong> extra information to show when the library is in normal or expanded list mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> whether you want Marvin to use a light or dark
                    keyboard. You can also set this to automatic. When the keyboard color is automatic,
                    Marvin will switch between light and dark mode depending the current color scheme.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick launch panel:</strong> the size of the quick launch panel in the home screen. The quick launch panel is not
                    available on smaller devices such as iPhones.</li>
                <li><strong>Home screen menus:</strong> Marvin has two main menus accessible from the home screen. The <em>collections
                    and sorting menu</em> (the menu behind the ‘M’ button), and the <em>main menu</em>. These are the two buttons in the top toolbar. You may find these menus to
                    be too long, so this setting helps you trim them down. For instance, if you know that you’ll never be sorting by
                    rating, you can remove it from the menus to make navigation easier.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Hardware keyboard or remote</h2>
            Configure hardware keyboard and Bluetooth remote control actions available while you’re in a book or comic. These key/actions are
            arranged in three groups:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keys in pagination mode or comics:</strong> set up keyboard commands applicable to books
                    opened in pagination (left/right) mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Keys in vertical scrolling mode:</strong> set up keyboard commands applicable to books opened in vertical
                    scrolling (up/down) mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Keys in all/any mode:</strong> these commands are applicable both in pagination and vertical scrolling modes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Behaviors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wikipedia language prefix:</strong> the language code to use when opening Wikipedia articles.
                    For instance, ‘en’ uses English-language Wikipedia, ‘fr’ uses French, and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>External browser:</strong> which web browser you’d like to use when opening external links.
                    If the web browser you choose isn’t installed on your device, Marvin will open links in In-App Safari.</li>
                <li><strong>Web search provider:</strong> which web search engine to use when performing web and image lookups.</li>
                <li><strong>Title display and sort:</strong> whether to display and sort using the title field
                    (e.g. ‘The Ring’), or using the title sort field (e.g. ‘Ring, The’). This function
                    might not work properly if the title sort field in the book’s metadata is missing, 
                    although in many cases Marvin will try and correct it for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Author display and sort:</strong> whether to display and sort using the author field
                    (e.g. ‘Bram Stoker’), or using the author sort field (e.g. ‘Stoker, Bram’). This function
                    might not work properly if the author sort field in the book’s metadata is missing, 
                    although in many cases Marvin will try and correct it for you.</li>
                <li><strong>App badge:</strong> determines what the icon badge counter shows. You can set this to 
                    the total number of books in your library, the number of books in your reading list, or other
                    useful metrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic geotagging:</strong> whether to attach geographic information to annotations you create.
                    This is very useful if you want to browse your annotations on maps, and filter by which country or city you took them.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch to last book:</strong> tells Marvin to open the most recently opened book on launch.</li>
                <li><strong>Can sleep while reading:</strong> determines whether your device can sleep (dim and turn off) while you’re reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-hide book toolbars:</strong> whether book toolbars are automatically hidden when you open a book.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-bookmark on close:</strong> when turned on, automatically creates a bookmark when a book is closed. Marvin
                    will not create an automatic bookmark if there’s already one close to your current position.</li>
                <li><strong>Show session time on close:</strong> shows how long you’ve been reading your book before you close it. This message is only shown if you’ve
                    been reading for at least two minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Pinch gesture in library:</strong> you can use a pinch in or pinch out gesture in your library to switch through viewing 
                    modes (e.g. lists or covers). Sometimes this gesture can interfere with iPad multitasking gestures so you can turn it off.</li>
                <li><strong>Morning and evening reminders:</strong> lets you set up reading reminder notifications.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Startup password</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Password:</strong> requests a password when Marvin starts up.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Touch ID:</strong> lets you use Touch ID to unlock Marvin. Touch ID requires a compatible device.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Dictionary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> here you can enter the URL scheme, or web URL for the dictionary you’d
                    like to use for look ups. In this case, use ‘{text}’ as the placeholder for the text you want to 
                    look up. If you leave this blank, Marvin will use the built-in iOS dictionary.</li>
                <li><strong>Presets:</strong> lets you choose from a list of popular online or app dictionaries. If your favorite 
                    dictionary isn’t in this list, let us know.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto dim dictionary:</strong> automatically dims system and custom dictionary popups (dark paper color = dim) to minimize bright popups at night.
                        Both system and custom dictionaries honor screen extra dimming and warmth settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Full screen custom lookups:</strong> whether Marvin should open custom web-based dictionaries in a
                        popup or full-screen (only applicable to iPad).</li>
                <li><strong>Normalize lookups:</strong> uses language-dependent corrections to remove contractions from the text you want to look up. This
                    increases the likelihood of a successful lookup. For instance, the lookup text ‘would’ve’ is normalized
                    to ‘would’.</li>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary builder:</strong> remembers words that you looked up in your annotations or journal for
                    future reference.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- ****************************************************************************** -->
            <h2>Advanced</h2>
            <p>Please <strong>BE CAREFUL</strong> when using advanced functions. Data may be lost and Marvin’s performance may be degraded.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backup and restore:</strong> backs up and restores Marvin including all your books, annotations, journal, metadata, and reading status. You can also use this function to migrate from Marvin Classic (version 2.x).</li>
                <li><strong>Skip enormous files:</strong> when this setting is enabled, Marvin will not attempt to import very large files files. These kinds of files may cause Marvin to crash.
                    Unless you really have to, it’s best to keep this setting on.</li>
                <li><strong>Send diagnostics:</strong> Marvin will create a diagnistics file that you can send for support related issues. This file contains information about Marvin, your settings, library, and annotations.</li>
                <li><strong>Reset Spotlight index:</strong> resets Marvin’s Spotlight index and will rebuild it from scratch later. If books do not appear in Spotlight searches, it could be that
                (1) Marvin is still indexing books, or (2) Spotlight is disabled for Marvin - to enable it, go to your Device’s settings app, choose General, Spotlight, then enable Marvin.</li>
                <li><strong>Reset Deep View:</strong> deletes all Deep View databases. Any stars or Deep View name annotations will be lost.
                    Your books and their annotations are not deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Reset book caches:</strong> frees up space by deleting any book caches that Marvin created. It is best to let Marvin automatically
                    manage its caches itself. This may temporarily slow down opening books.</li>
            </ul>
